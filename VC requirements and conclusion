Software Requirements:
• Operating Systems: Windows 10 & Above Operating system
• Software used: Arduino 2.0 Software
• Coding Language: C
Hardware Requirements:
• Arduino Uno : Arduino uno is Microcontroller with ATMega238p that performs the given task.
• L298D Motor Driver Sheild:L293D is a monolithic integrated, high voltage, high current, 4-channel driver.
• HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor :An Ultrasonic sensor is a device that can measure the distance to an object by using sound waves.
• SG-90 Servo Motor: A servo motor is an electrical device which can push or rotate an object with great precision.
• DC Motor:- A Direct Current (DC) motor is a rotating electrical device that converts direct current, of electrical energy, into mechanical energy.
• DC Gear Motor:-The most common electrical motors convert electrical energy to mechanical energy. A gear motor is an all-in-one combination of a motor and gearbox.

conclusion:
In this project Smart Vacuum Cleaner has been implemented. It was works on a pre-defined code inserted in Arduino UNO. Whenever RC car encounters any obstacle, it turns to the side where the
distance between obstacle and car is more. This project helps collect the dust using a vacuum cleaner made using CPU fan and batteries without human intervention thereby reducing the hazards to
human health. This is a simple and cost-effective cleaner. However, using a detachable bag may be better as removing the dust becomes simpler.
