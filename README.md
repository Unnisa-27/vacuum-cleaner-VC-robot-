IoT based SMART VACCUM CLEANER , it is a device used for sweeping with the help of an air pump.

IoT is part of Todays communication. In today’s world IoT is fast growing and interesting field. It is simplest way for latest technology modification. Now a day’s communication is part of advancement of technology, so I decided to work on IoT field, and design something which will make human life simpler in today aspect. In this project, an automated vacuum cleaner is designed. It consists of a RC car to which a vacuum cleaner is attached. Ultrasonic Sensor is attached to the front of the car which is used to measure the distance if any obstacle is detected. If suppose there is an obstacle, the car changes its course as per the code. Vacuum cleaner consists of CPU Fan which runs by a battery. At the front of cleaner, a pipe is attached to suck the dust from the floor. The cleaner has space to collect the dust. Once it gets filled, it should be removed and cleaned manually. Vacuum cleaner will be carried on the RC car and the direction of the wheels depend on the code uploaded to the Arduino
